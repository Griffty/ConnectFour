## Introduction

The project is a Java-based Connect Four game build with Maven. The game can be played in two modes: Command Line Interface (CLI) and Graphical User Interface (GUI). The mode is determined based on the environment in which the application is launched.
The game offers several launch options, including solo play, hosting a game for people in the local network, joining a game in the local network, and playing against a computer (AI). The launch options can be specified as command-line arguments or chosen from a dialog in the GUI mode.  The project uses several dependencies tyrus-server and tyrus-container-grizzly-server for WebSocket server implementation and gson for JSON processing. The Main class is the entry point of the application.
